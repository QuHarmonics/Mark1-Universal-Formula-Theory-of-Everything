A scientific visualization of black hole accretion and evaporation, showing a dynamic interplay of matter spiraling into a glowing accretion disk around a black hole. Energetic feedback loops are represented as bright, focused jets emitting from the poles, with glowing arcs illustrating harmonic resonance in spacetime. The surrounding environment includes gravitational wave ripples, scattered stars, and interstellar gas illuminated by the accretion disk's intense energy. Labels and annotations highlight energy dissipation, mass-loss rates, and Hawking radiation processes. The overall design is sleek, cosmic, and detailed, presenting an academic yet visually stunning representation of black hole dynamics.
