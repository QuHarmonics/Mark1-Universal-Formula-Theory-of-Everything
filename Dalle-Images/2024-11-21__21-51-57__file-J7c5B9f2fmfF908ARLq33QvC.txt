A refined T-shirt design featuring the formula "F = (Macro Law Component)⋅(1 + e^−10(ax−0.35))" prominently displayed in a bold, legible font overlaying a quantum-inspired background. The background is centered and slightly smaller to ensure the formula stands out clearly, with glowing particles, wave-like patterns, and fractal geometry subtly enhancing the design. The shirt itself is plain black to highlight the formula and background, creating a sleek and professional look suitable for promoting the concept.
