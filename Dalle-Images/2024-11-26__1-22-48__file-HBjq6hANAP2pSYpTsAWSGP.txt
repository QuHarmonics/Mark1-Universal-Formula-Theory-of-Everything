A hyper-advanced 3D hierarchical model of Universe 000 with dynamic interactivity, temporal evolution, and multidimensional connections. The visualization includes glowing, color-coded nodes representing interfaces, methods, and data flows, layered into base and extended classes. Dynamic pathways and particle trails illustrate cross-layer interactions, while real-time feedback loops optimize resonance stability at 99.999%. The model features animated connections showing temporal dynamics, analytical tools for energy flow and harmonic optimization, and inter-universal gateways linking to adjacent systems. The background includes multidimensional grids and annotations providing context, creating an immersive, visually stunning representation of a universal system harmonized at 0.35.
