A 3D representation of a hierarchical interface tree for Universe 000, modeled with intricate branching structures and connections. The visualization includes layered nodes representing classes, methods, and interactions, displayed as glowing spheres connected by dynamic pathways. Each layer represents a depth of complexity, with luminous feedback loops and multidimensional grids in the background. The design is futuristic, immersive, and visually striking, blending scientific precision with an abstract aesthetic to capture the elegance of a complex, multidimensional system.
