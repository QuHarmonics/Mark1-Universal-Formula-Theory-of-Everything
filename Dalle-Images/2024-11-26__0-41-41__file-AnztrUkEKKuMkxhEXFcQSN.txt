A scientific visualization of a quantum system with feedback, showing a dynamic quantum harmonic oscillator stabilized by feedback loops. The system is depicted as glowing quantum wavefunctions interacting with recursive feedback pathways represented by luminous, spiraling loops. The visualization includes quantum oscillations, phase adjustments, and feedback-enhanced resonance. The background features a sleek, futuristic grid with annotated labels for feedback terms, wave coherence, and resonance stabilization. The design is abstract yet highly detailed, highlighting the interaction of quantum states with feedback mechanisms.
