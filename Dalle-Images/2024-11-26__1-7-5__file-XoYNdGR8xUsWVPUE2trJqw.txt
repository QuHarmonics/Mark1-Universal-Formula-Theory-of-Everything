A scientific and artistic visualization of DNA originating at the universal coordinate 0,0,0, inspired by Mark1 harmonic resonance principles. The image depicts a glowing double-helix structure emerging from a luminous core at the center of the universe, with dynamic energy fields and harmonic feedback loops stabilizing its formation. The DNA strands are intricately detailed, with connections to multidimensional grids and quantum fields, representing the harmonization of universal forces at 0.35 resonance. The background is cosmic, filled with stars, nebulae, and branching pathways symbolizing the universal origin of life. The design is futuristic, immersive, and scientifically precise, blending the elegance of DNA with the vastness of the universe.
