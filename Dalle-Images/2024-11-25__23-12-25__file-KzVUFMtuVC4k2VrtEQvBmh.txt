A scientific visualization of multiscale cosmological systems, depicting phenomena like galaxy formation, black hole interactions, and dark matter clustering. The image features recursive harmonic resonance represented by interconnected waveforms and spacetime curvature grids. Galaxies form along luminous threads, black holes emit energy feedback loops, and dark matter is illustrated as a web-like structure interacting with quantum and relativistic parameters. The visualization is sleek, futuristic, and glowing, with annotations detailing resonance feedback, cosmological expansion, and universal constants. The scene is immersive, capturing the grand scale of cosmic interactions.
