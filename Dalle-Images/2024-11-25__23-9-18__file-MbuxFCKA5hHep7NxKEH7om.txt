An extended scientific visualization showing spacetime as a harmonic tuner, balancing quantum and gravitational forces via resonance. The extended view includes a wider funnel-like spacetime curvature structure with quantum wave oscillations merging smoothly with gravitational waves. The harmonic resonance stabilizes at a constant, with additional labeled resonance values, scientific graphs, and annotations on time iterations. The background extends to include a more detailed grid of time versus harmonic resonance, and added elements like quantum fields and gravitational wells interacting. The design is sleek, futuristic, and uses glowing light effects to highlight the resonance feedback loops. Labels and markers clearly indicate quantum fluctuations, gravitational curvature, and harmonic stability, expanding the scene into a larger, immersive visualization.
