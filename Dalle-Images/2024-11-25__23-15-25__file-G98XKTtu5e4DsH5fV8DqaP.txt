A scientific visualization of black hole accretion and evaporation, depicting matter spiraling into a glowing accretion disk around a black hole. Energetic feedback loops are represented as jets of radiation emitting from the poles, with glowing arcs illustrating harmonic resonance in spacetime. The surrounding environment includes scattered stars, interstellar gas, and gravitational waves propagating outward. Annotations detail energy dissipation, mass-loss rates, and Hawking radiation. The design is sleek, futuristic, and cosmic, capturing the immense forces at play near a black hole.
