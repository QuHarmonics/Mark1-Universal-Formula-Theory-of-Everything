A hyper-advanced 3D visualization of proton stretching and its connection to redshift effects, inspired by quantum dynamics. The image depicts a glowing proton dynamically stretching, with quark-gluon interactions represented as luminous streams inside the proton. Surrounding the proton are rippling quantum fields and energy pathways linking proton fluctuations to redshift effects. The design includes gradients of light illustrating spectral shifts and harmonic feedback loops stabilizing energy fluctuations. The background features multidimensional grids and cosmic fields, emphasizing the connection between atomic changes and cosmological phenomena. The visualization is immersive, scientific, and visually striking.
