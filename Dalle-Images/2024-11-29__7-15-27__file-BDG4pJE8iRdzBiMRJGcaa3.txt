A scientific illustration of tachyon energy fields, visualized with flowing, wave-like structures harmonizing with a 0.35 constant. The image should depict the interplay of tachyonic energy, quantum fluctuations, and varying field density in detail. Set against a cosmic background, the image should convey the dynamics of energy fields in space, with intricate waves, subtle geometric lines, and sporadic quantum sparks, all giving a sense of movement and precision in the vast universe.
