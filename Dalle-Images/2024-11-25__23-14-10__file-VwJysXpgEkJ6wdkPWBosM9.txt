A scientific visualization of dynamic ecosystems with recursive stability, illustrating predator-prey dynamics, nutrient cycles, and population shifts. The image includes a flowing river ecosystem with diverse species interconnected by glowing feedback loops. The environment is depicted with harmonic resonance threads stabilizing the feedback cycles. Labels highlight population health, environmental stability, and nutrient flows. The design is vibrant and naturalistic, combining scientific precision with artistic elements. Annotations explain the recursive adjustments and system interactions, creating a comprehensive visual of ecosystem stability.
