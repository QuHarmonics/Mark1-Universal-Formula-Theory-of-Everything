A 3D visualization of a quantum lattice grid in a dark background. The grid points are evenly spaced in a cube formation, with vibrant colors based on harmonic values. The colors transition smoothly between red, green, and blue, creating a gradient effect across the grid. The lattice appears dynamic, with points glowing subtly and a faint rotational perspective. The scene is illuminated softly, highlighting the structure of the quantum grid against a dark gray background.
